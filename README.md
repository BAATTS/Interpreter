# Interpreter

Over the course of the six phases, I construct an interpreter for a small imperative language, that
we call L-imp. In this phase I was interested in a subset of the language, called L-exp, i.e., the language of
expressions that I have already built a scanner for in a previous phase.
For the current phase I constructed the evaluator module for L-exp. 

The evaluator receives the AST of a program and returns the result of evaluation.
